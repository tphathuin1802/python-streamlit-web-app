    """ In the era of Industry 4.0, e-commerce has grown rapidly, completely changing the way of shopping and traditional business models. Businesses of all sizes are taking advantage of digital platforms to reach customers more quickly and effectively. Sales in e-commerce have become fiercely competitive, requiring sellers to be creative, flexible and use optimal tools to attract and retain customers. Through this overview, we will better understand the role of technology and data in increasing business efficiency and creating competitive advantages.

Walmart is the world's leading retail brand, known for its "Always Low Prices" strategy that helps attract customers and maintain a competitive advantage. Heavy investment in technology has helped Walmart optimize its supply chain and enhance the user experience, affirming the role of technology in modern retail. Walmart also has a large economic and social impact in the markets in which it operates. Notably, in India, Walmart acquired e-commerce company Flipkart in 2018, expanding its influence and strongly participating in this potential e-commerce market. However, Walmart also faces policy challenges and competition from big rivals like Amazon, requiring flexible strategies to maintain its position.

Hence, this is the reason why our group choose this topic.
