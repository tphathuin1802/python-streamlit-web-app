            Electronics and Clothing stand out as the top categories, appealing broadly across all genders on Walmart India's platform. Female customers show particular interest in Electronics and have a strong engagement in both Sports & Fitness and Beauty & Health categories, highlighting their diverse shopping preferences. Male customers exhibit high engagement in Clothing, making it the most popular category for this group.

            Seasonal Fluctuations: Sales start at around 12 million in January but dip to the lowest point of 10 million in February. After that, there is a gradual recovery in March and April, with sales stabilizing between 13 million to 14 million from April to September.
Mid-Year Drop: A noticeable decline occurs in June, where sales drop to nearly 11 million, making it one of the lower-performing months of the year. This could indicate a seasonal slowdown in purchases during the middle of the year.
Year-End Surge: Starting in October, there is a steady and significant increase in sales each month, culminating in the highest sales of the year in December at around 18 million. This sharp rise towards the end of the year likely reflects increased consumer spending due to holiday seasons and end-of-year promotions.
The chart highlights a cyclical sales pattern, with a low point in February, steady sales through mid-year, and a strong surge in the final quarter. This pattern could be valuable for Walmart India in planning seasonal promotions, inventory management, and marketing strategies to maximize sales during peak months like December.
